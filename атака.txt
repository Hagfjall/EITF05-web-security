            exploit some sort of error in shopping_cart.php
            - add xss code as a queryparam and don't encode it
            - send malicious request url to some peasant
            - wait as the server sees invalid product id
            - jump in happiness as server sends template "couldn't find product: $VAR"
            - and $VAR is set in php to xss code and is executed as javascript by
                - incorrect use of innerHTML, or
                - retarded use of eval, or
                - insert hacker knowledge here
